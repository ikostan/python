"""
Flower Field is a compassionate reimagining of the popular game Minesweeper.

This module provides helpers to validate and annotate a rectangular garden
representation, where each row is a string comprised of spaces and ``*``
characters. A ``*`` denotes a flower; a space denotes an empty square.

The goal is to compute numeric hints indicating how many flowers are
directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to each square.
