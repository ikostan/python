Matching Brackets.

You're given the opportunity to write software for the Bracketeer™,
an ancient but powerful mainframe. The software that runs on it is
written in a proprietary language. Much of its syntax is familiar,
but you notice lots of brackets, braces and parentheses. Despite
the Bracketeer™ being powerful, it lacks flexibility. If the source
code has any unbalanced brackets, braces or parentheses, the Bracketeer™
crashes and must be rebooted. To avoid such a scenario, you start writing
code that can verify that brackets, braces, and parentheses are balanced
before attempting to run it on the Bracketeer™.

    Verify that any and all pairs of brackets are matched.

    Given a string containing brackets [], braces {}, parentheses (),
    or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched
    and nested correctly. Any other characters should be ignored. For example,
    "{what is (42)}?" is balanced and "[text}" is not.
